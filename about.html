        Hello! Welcome to my about me page!  I'm an 18 year old fresh out of highschool and I've always had a passion for computer and tech related things. Since a little kid Christmas and Birthday gifts like puzzles and tech accessories were very common. I built my own PC which I love to play games with my friends on, I've had it for close to 5 years now and continue to upgrade it and keep it running smooth. I have a fluffy black cat named Mash who's a little over 7 now and a tarantula, who my sister named Elizabeth; who's around 5-6.
