      <section class="mashncar"> <p class="first-ab-p"> Hello! Welcome to my about me page! I'm an 18 year old fresh out of highschool and I've always had a passion for computer and tech related things. Since a little kid Christmas and Birthday gifts like puzzles and tech accessories were very common. I built my own PC which I love to play games with my friends on, I've had it for close to 5 years now and continue to upgrade it and keep it running smooth. I have a fluffy black cat named Mash who's a little over 7 now and a tarantula, who my sister named Elizabeth; who's around 5-6. </p> <img class="mash" src="/media/mash.jpg" alt="mash"/>

        When I'm not playing games or out with friends I'm working on my car. Since getting my license, cars have become a HUGE passion of mine and something I've grown to love (for the most part). Since 16 I've had 4 cars, project after project. April of this year I traded my 1993 Mazda Miata for my now 1990 Acura Integra. I've redone the majority of the suspension, interior, and now im onto the exterior. I love this car and cant wait to finish it.
